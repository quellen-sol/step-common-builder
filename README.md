# Installation

1. Move `build-common` to a path exported in your `PATH` var

2. Add the contents of the `.bashrc` file to your `.bashrc` (Usually at `~/.bashrc`)

3. Adjust the directories in both files to your needs.

# Example of my directory setup
`~/dev` contains:

`~/dev/step-frontend`

`~/dev/step-analytics`

`~/dev/step-common`

`~/dev/step-backend/step-api-services`

`~/dev/step-backend/step-api-gateway`

`~/dev/step-backend/step-indexer`

So the autocompletions match this based on the `~/dev` directory
